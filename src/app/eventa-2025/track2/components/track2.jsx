           Given a realistic caption, participants are required to retrieve corresponding images from a provided database. This retrieval task is a fundamental task in computer vision and natural language processing that requires learning a joint representation space where visual and textual modalities can be meaningfully compared. Image retrieval with textual queries is widely used in search engines, medical imaging, e-commerce, and digital asset management. However, challenges remain, such as handling abstract or ambiguous queries, improving retrieval efficiency for large-scale datasets, and ensuring robustness to linguistic variations and biases in training data. This image retrieval track aims to tackle issues of realistic information from events in real life.
