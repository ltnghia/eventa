           The EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge focuses on image-caption retrieval and generation. We aim to integrate contextual details and event-related information to create comprehensive, narrative-driven captions that go beyond simple visual analysis. Therefore, the captions provide richer, more comprehensive information about an image. These captions go beyond simple visual descriptions by offering deeper insights, including the names and attributes of objects, the timing, context, outcomes of events, and other crucial details - information that cannot be gleaned from merely observing the image.
