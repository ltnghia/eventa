              Traditional image analysis methods—like captioning, object detection, or segmentation—tend to focus on what’s visible: people, objects, and actions. But in real-world scenarios, just recognizing &quot;people are watching TV&quot; isn’t enough.

              EVENTA aims to transform how machines interpret images by enriching them with event-level understanding. We go beyond surface-level descriptions to capture:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Who is involved</li>
              <li>🕒 When & Where the event takes place</li>
              <li>📖 What is happening</li>
              <li>🧩 Why it’s significant</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <p>
              We combine visual cues with contextual reasoning to create narrative-rich, informative captions that tell the full story behind the image.

              Understanding an image isn’t just about identifying what’s in it—it’s about making sense of its context, implications, and human relevance.
